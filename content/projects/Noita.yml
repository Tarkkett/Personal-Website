title: High power rocketry
description: In order to achieve my longterm dream of acquiring the L1 certification for High Power Rocketry(HPR) I had to design and manufacture a custom rocket that would use a G class motor and would reach an apogee of 1000 meters. I had a goal to design it in such a way, that if I were to use a larger motor for an L2 certification flight, I would have to make only minimal changes to the rocket design. See how it all went here.
