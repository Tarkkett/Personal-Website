title: Differential swerve FTC robot 
description: Together with a teammate, I spent two years designing and building a differential swerve FTC robot. While it wasn’t a competition winner, the project pushed us to explore advanced mechanics, control systems, and countless late-night problem-solving sessions—an invaluable hands-on learning experience.
