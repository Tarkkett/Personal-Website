title: First Global Challenge
description: In 2022 and 2024, I represented Lithuania with my team in the First Global Challenge. This was my first competition, where I not only gained hands-on robotics experience but also learned how to direct and produce a promotional video for our team. In 2022, together with my buddy Matas, we built a robot that became world champion in Geneva.
