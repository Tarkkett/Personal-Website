  title: "About Me"
  description: |
    I’m a 19-year-old Electrical Engineering student at Eindhoven University of Technology with a background in robotics, programming, system administration, and cybersecurity. Over the past few years, I’ve been part of award-winning teams — including winning gold at the Robotics World Olympics (First Global Challenge) in Geneva — and leading robot design in the First Tech Challenge. 
    My interests go beyond robotics: I’ve built websites, developed games, explored high-power rocketry, and recently joined the Lithuanian national cybersecurity team for the European Cybersecurity Challenge. I thrive in environments where teamwork, innovation, and persistence meet, and I’m always eager to learn new skills and tackle ambitious challenges.
    Outside of tech, I enjoy mountaineering, snowboarding, gokarts and hackathons. Whether on the track, in the lab, or out in nature, I bring the same focus: pushing limits, solving problems, and always staying curious.
